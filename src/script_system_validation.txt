Hello, and welcome to the study. My name is Nao.

Today, you will be helping me build and sort Legos.  You can see the Legos in front of you.

First, I need to make sure you can understand my instructions. I will name an object, and your job is to touch the object I name. You only need to briefly touch the object. I will move quickly. If you are unsure, just pick an object to touch as quickly and accurately as possible.

If you have any questions, now is the time to ask the experimenter.

Great! Let's begin.
