Great! Let's move on.

Now, you can help me build and sort these Legos. I will give you a list of instructions. Your job is to memorize this list. Once I am done, you will complete the instructions you've memorized as quickly and accurately as you can.

There is a timer on the computer next to you. When I am finished giving instructions, you will time how long it takes you to complete them. I will tell you when to press start on the timer. Do not press it now. The computer has a touch screen so you can press the button with your finger.

If you have any questions, now is the time to ask the experimenter.

[head press]

Alright, let's begin. Remember, I will give you all of the instructions first. Don't touch the blocks until I say you can.

[instructions 1 start]

# Task 1 here

[instructions 1 stop]

That concludes the instructions. When I tell you to begin, press the start button on the timer to your right, then sort the blocks according to my instructions. Press the stop button when you are finished. Begin now.

Good job. That was fun, right? Let's do it again. Please pull all of the blocks out of the bins, take them apart, and put them on the table in front of you. For me to see the blocks, they have to be below the line of tape on the table and the tags have to be facing me.

When you're done placing the blocks on the table, press the reset button on the timer to continue.

Okay. I will give you a new set of instructions. Please listen to all of my instructions first. When I say so, you can start the timer and begin completing the instructions.

[1]
[instructions 2 start]

# Task 2 here

[instructions 2 stop]

[interruption start] # if interruption condition, wait for head press

[interruption stop] # if interruption condition, wait for head press

[2]

That concludes the instructions. When I tell you to begin, press the start button on the timer to your right, then sort the blocks according to my instructions. Press the stop button when you are finished. Begin now.

[timer stop]

Great job! This experiment is over. Thank you for playing with me. You can let the experimenter know that you are finished now.
