Hello, and welcome to the study. My name is Nao.

Today, you will be helping me build and sort Legos.  You can see the Legos in front of you.

First, I need to make sure you can understand my instructions. I will name an object, and your job is to identify that object. There is a computer with a touch screen to your right. When I name an object, touch the button corresponding to that object as quickly and accurately as you can.

I will move quickly. If you are unsure which object I mean, just pick one as quickly and accurately as possible.

If you have any questions, now is the time to ask the experimenter.
