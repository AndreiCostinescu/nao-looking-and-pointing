Hello, and welcome to the study. My name is Nao.

Today, you will be helping me build and sort Legos. <1> You can see the Legos in front of you.

First, I need to make sure you can understand my instructions. I will name an object, and your job is to touch the object I mention. You only need to briefly touch the object. I will move quickly. If you are unsure, just pick an object as quickly as possible. Are you ready?
