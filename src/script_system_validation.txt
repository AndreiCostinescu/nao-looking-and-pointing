Hello, and welcome to the study. My name is Nao.

Today, you will be helping me build and sort Legos.  You can see the Legos in front of you.

First, I need to make sure you can understand my instructions. I will name a block, and your job is to identify that block. There is a computer with a touch screen to your right. When I name a block, touch the button corresponding to that object as quickly and accurately as you can.

Notice that there are two red blocks and two blue blocks on the table. For this calibration, I might look or point at a block to clarify which one I mean. On the computer screen, the words left and right refer to your own point of view. For example, the blue block on the right is the one to YOUR right.

This calibration goes quickly. If you are unsure which block I mean, just pick one as quickly and accurately as possible.

If you have any questions, now is the time to ask the experimenter.
