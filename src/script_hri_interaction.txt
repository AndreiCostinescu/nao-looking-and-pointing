Now, you can help me build and sort these Legos. I will give you a list of instructions. Your job is to memorize this list. Once I am done, you will complete the instructions you've memorized as quickly and accurately as you can.

There is a timer on the computer next to you. When I am finished giving instructions, you will use this timer to measure how long it takes you to complete the task.

The computer has a touch screen so you can press the button with your finger. To practice, press start on the timer now.

Excellent. You will use the timer to measure how long it takes you to complete the instructions you've memorized. It is important that you listen to all of my instructions before starting the task or the timer. I will tell you when to begin.

Good job. That was fun, right? Let's do it again. Please pull all of the blocks out of the bins, take them apart, and put them on the table in front of you. For me to see the blocks, they have to be below the line of tape on the table and the tags have to be facing me.

When you're done placing the blocks on the table, press the reset button on the timer to continue.
